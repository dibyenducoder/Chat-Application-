The goal of this project is to create a collaborative online chat room for multiple users, 
by learning new technologies like node.js (using packages like socket.io for managing websockets 
and express for deploying the server) and basic HTML and javascript (using jQuery library) 
for the client side.


How to deploy the server
For deploying the server, you will need to install both node.js 
and npm (node package manager). You can do this very easly by opening a 
linux terminal and using apt-get:

sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm
Then, after the installs are complete, download all the required packages with npm 
and deploy the server using node! You can do that by running the following commands:
